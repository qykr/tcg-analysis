Specifically:\n- $T_i$ represents the total distinct water levels (marks) from day 1 to day $i$.\n- For each day $i$, $T_i = m_i + d_i + 1$, which rearranges to $d_i = T_i - m_i - 1$.\n- The sum of $d_i$ over all days is $\\sum (T_i - m_i - 1) = (\\sum T_i) - (\\sum m_i) - n$.\n\nThus, minimizing the sum of $d_i$ reduces to minimizing $\\sum T_i$, since $\\sum m_i$ and $n$ are fixed.\n\n### Constraints on $T_i$\n1. **Non-decreasing $T_i$**: $T_i \\geq T_{i-1}$ because the number of distinct marks can only stay the same or increase each day.\n2. **Minimum $T_i$ from $m_i$**: $T_i \\geq m_i + 1$ because there must be at least $m_i$ marks above the water level plus the water level itself.\n3. **Future constraints**: For any future day $j > i$, $T_j \\leq T_i + (j - i)$ (since at most one new mark can be added per day).

The challenge lies in processing these operations efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of holes (N) and the number of operations (M) can be as large as 100,000. A naive approach of simulating each jump step-by-step for every query would be too slow, so we use a technique called sqrt decomposition to optimize the operations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the path of a ball thrown into a hole, where each hole's power determines the next hole the ball jumps to. The ball exits the row when it jumps beyond the last hole. For each query, we need to output the last hole visited before exiting and the total number of jumps made.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Since each hole's jump always moves to a higher-indexed hole (or exits), the structure forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with edges pointing right. This allows us to process nodes from right to left for efficient path computation.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: We use sqrt decomposition to divide the holes into blocks of size approximately \u221aN.

For any node at index `i`, its left child is at `2i + 1` and right child at `2i + 2`. The levels can be determined by:\n   - Level 0: 1 node (index 0)\n   - Level 1: 2 nodes (indices 1-2)\n   - Level 2: 4 nodes (indices 3-6)\n   - Level `k`: up to `2^k` nodes\n2. **Process Each Level**: For each level, calculate the start and end indices in the array. The start index for level `k` is `2^k - 1`, and the end index is `min(2^(k+1) - 1, N-1)`. However, a simpler approach is to iterate level by level, starting with the first node, then processing `2^level` nodes for each subsequent level.\n3. **Sort Each Level**: For each level's nodes, sort them in ascending order before adding to the result.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Test Inputs\n\n#### Test Input 1: N = 7, arr = [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n- **Level 0**: Start index = 0, size = 1 \u2192 nodes = [7] \u2192 sorted = [7]\n- **Level 1**: Start index = 1, size = 2 \u2192 nodes = [6, 5] \u2192 sorted = [5, 6]\n- **Level 2**: Start index = 3, size = 4 \u2192 nodes = [4, 3, 2, 1] \u2192 sorted = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n- **Level 3**: Start index = 7 (\u2265 N), so stop.\n- **Output**: \n  ```\n  7\n  5 6\n  1 2 3 4\n  ```\n\n#### Test Input 2: N = 6, arr = [5, 6, 4, 9, 2, 1]\n- **Level 0**: Start index = 0, size = 1 \u2192 nodes = [5] \u2192 sorted = [5]\n- **Level 1**: Start index = 1, size = 2 \u2192 nodes = [6, 4] \u2192 sorted = [4, 6]\n- **Level 2**: Start index = 3, size = 4 \u2192 but N=6, so nodes = [9, 2, 1] \u2192 sorted = [1, 2, 9]\n- **Level 3**: Start index = 7 (\u2265 N), so stop.\n- **Output**: \n  ```\n  5\n  4 6\n  1 2 9\n  ```", "inputs": ["N = 7\narr[] = {7 6 5 4 3 2 1}", "N = 6\narr[] = {5 6 4 9 2 1}"], "expected_outputs": ["7\n5 6\n1 2 3 4", "5\n4 6\n1 2 9"], "generated_outputs": ["7\n5 6\n1 2 3 4", "5\n4 6\n1 2 9"], "confusion_matrix": {"true_positives": 2, "true_negatives": 0, "false_positives": 0, "false_negatives": 0, "accuracy": 1.0, "precision": 1.0, "recall": 1.0, "f1_score": 1.0, "specificity": 0.0, "total_samples": 2}}

The goal is to find such a list `B` with the minimum possible sum of its elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires constructing a list `B` where each consecutive pair in `B` has a GCD equal to the corresponding element in `A`. The challenge is to ensure the sum of elements in `B` is minimized.\n2. **Key Insight**: The minimal sum is achieved by setting each element in `B` (except the first and last) to the least common multiple (LCM) of the adjacent elements in `A`. Specifically:\n   - The first element of `B` is set to the first element of `A`.\n   - The last element of `B` is set to the last element of `A`.\n   - For each intermediate element `B[i]` (where `1 \u2264 i \u2264 N-1`), it is set to the LCM of `A[i-1]` and `A[i]`.\n3. **Why LCM?**: The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

This is because each operation involving 'A' and 'B' consumes one 'A' and one 'B', and each operation involving 'B' and 'C' consumes one 'B' and one 'C'. Thus, the total 'B's consumed must be the sum of 'A's and 'C's.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning for Each Test Case\nFor each test case in the additional inputs:\n- **Input 1**:\n  - \"ABACAB\": Length 6 (even).

However, the sample outputs (e.g., 51 for $ n=10 $) imply that the actual requirement is to count all distinct substrings formed by **all simple paths within the subtree of $ v $** (i.e., paths between any two nodes in the subtree), not just paths starting at $ v $. This is because the maximum possible count for paths starting at $ v $ cannot exceed the subtree size, but the sample outputs (like 51 for $ n=10 $) exceed this limit.\n\n2. **Small Input Analysis**:\n   - **Input 1 (n=2)**: Vertices 1 ('a') and 2 ('b') connected by an edge. The subtree of vertex 1 includes both nodes. All possible paths:\n     - Single nodes: \"a\", \"b\"\n     - Paths between nodes: \"ab\", \"ba\"\n     - Total distinct substrings: 4.

Instead, we use a sqrt decomposition technique to preprocess the data, allowing us to answer each query in O(sqrt(N)) time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the path of a ball thrown into a hole, where each jump moves the ball to the next hole based on the current hole's power.

The game involves a series of operations on holes arranged in a row, where each hole has a specific power. The operations include updating the power of a hole or simulating the path of a ball thrown into a hole, counting the number of jumps before it exits the row and identifying the last hole visited.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves processing two types of operations:\n   - **Update Operation (0 a b)**: Set the power of hole `a` to `b`.\n   - **Query Operation (1 a)**: Simulate throwing a ball into hole `a` and determine the last hole visited before the ball exits the row and the total number of jumps made.\n\n2. **Intuition**: For each query operation, the straightforward approach is to simulate the ball's path step-by-step. Starting from the given hole, repeatedly jump to the next hole (current hole + power of current hole) until the next position is outside the row. During this simulation, we track the last valid hole visited and the count of jumps made.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: Given the constraints (N and M up to 10^5), a naive simulation for each query could be inefficient in the worst case (O(N*M)). However, the problem specifies that correctness for very small test cases is sufficient, so we prioritize simplicity over optimization.

The simulation starts at hole `a`, and in each step:\n     - The current hole is recorded as the last valid hole.\n     - The next position is calculated as `current hole + power of current hole`.\n     - The jump count is incremented.\n     - The loop continues until the next position is outside the row (i.e., greater than N).\n3. **Output Handling**: For each query, the last hole visited and the jump count are stored in a list and printed at the end.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem by directly simulating each query, ensuring correctness for small inputs while maintaining simplicity.

The constraints are that consecutive eaten boxes must have different colors and strictly increasing candy counts. The time is spent only on moving between boxes, as eating is instantaneous.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: Tanya starts at a given position `s` (1-indexed). She can move to adjacent boxes (left or right) in 1 second per move. When she eats from a box, all candies in that box are consumed, and the box remains empty. The key constraints are:\n   - The first eaten box has no restrictions on color or candy count.\n   - Subsequent eaten boxes must have strictly more candies than the previous one and a different color.\n   \n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP table `dp[i][j]` where:\n   - `i` represents the index of the last eaten box (0-indexed).\n   - `j` represents the total candies eaten so far (capped at `k` since any value beyond `k` is irrelevant).\n   - The value `dp[i][j]` stores the minimal time required to reach this state.\n\n3. **Initialization**:\n   - For each box `i`, calculate the time to move from the starting position `s` to `i` (i.e., `abs(s-1 - i)`).\n   - If the candies in box `i` (`r[i]`) is at least `k`, set `dp[i][k]` to this time.\n   - Otherwise, set `dp[i][r[i]]` to this time.\n\n4. **DP State Transition**:\n   - For each possible total candies `j` (from 0 to `k-1`), and for each box `i` (last eaten box), check all other boxes `ni`:\n     - Ensure `ni` is not the same as `i`.\n     - Ensure `r[ni] > r[i]` and the colors of boxes `i` and `ni` are different.\n     - Update the DP state for `ni` with the new total candies (`j + r[ni]`, capped at `k`) and the new time (`dp[i][j] + abs(i - ni)`).\n\n5. **Result Extraction**: After processing all states, the answer is the minimal value in `dp[i][k]` for all boxes `i`. If no such state exists (i.e., all values remain at the initial large value), return `-1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    data = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n, s, k = map(int, data[0].split())\n    r = list(map(int, data[1].split()))\n    colors = data[2].strip()\n    \n    big = 10**9\n    dp = [[big] * (k+1) for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    start_index = s - 1\n    for i in range(n):\n        time0 = abs(start_index - i)\n        total0 = r[i]\n        if total0 >= k:\n            if time0 < dp[i][k]:\n                dp[i][k] = time0\n        else:\n            if time0 < dp[i][total0]:\n                dp[i][total0] = time0\n                \n    for j in range(0, k):\n        for i in range(n):\n            if dp[i][j] == big:\n                continue\n            for ni in range(n):\n                if i == ni:\n                    continue\n                if r[ni] <= r[i]:\n                    continue\n                if colors[i] == colors[ni]:\n                    continue\n                new_total = j + r[ni]\n                if new_total >= k:\n                    new_total = k\n                new_time = dp[i][j] + abs(i - ni)\n                if new_time < dp[ni][new_total]:\n                    dp[ni][new_total] = new_time\n                    \n    ans = big\n    for i in range(n):\n        if dp[i][k] < ans:\n            ans = dp[i][k]\n            \n    if ans == big:\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of boxes `n`, starting position `s`, and the minimum candies `k` to eat. The next lines provide the candy counts per box and their colors.\n2. **DP Initialization**: A 2D list `dp` is initialized with a large value (`big`). For each box, the initial time to move from `s` to the box is calculated. If the box's candies meet or exceed `k`, it's stored in `dp[i][k]`; otherwise, it's stored in `dp[i][r[i]]`.\n3. **State Transitions**: For each possible total candies `j` (from 0 to `k-1`), and each box `i`, the algorithm checks all other boxes `ni` to see if they can be the next eaten box (satisfying color and candy count constraints). The DP state for `ni` is updated if a shorter time is found.\n4. **Result Extraction**: The minimal time to achieve at least `k` candies is found by checking `dp[i][k]` for all boxes. If no valid state exists, `-1` is printed; otherwise, the minimal time is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible sequences of eaten boxes while adhering to constraints, leveraging dynamic programming to minimize the movement time.

The goal is to find the minimal movement time to accumulate at least `k` candies while respecting the color and candy count constraints.\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequence of eaten boxes must be strictly increasing in candy count and alternating in color.

The challenge lies in processing these operations efficiently, especially given the constraints where both the number of holes (N) and the number of operations (M) can be as large as 100,000.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem involves simulating the path of a ball thrown into a hole, where each hole's power determines the next hole the ball jumps to. The ball continues jumping until it exits the row of holes. For each query, we need to report the last hole visited before exiting and the total number of jumps made.\n\n2. **Intuition**: Directly simulating each query step-by-step would be too slow for large inputs (O(N) per query, leading to O(M*N) worst-case time). Instead, we use a technique called **sqrt decomposition** to break the problem into manageable blocks. This allows us to process each query in O(sqrt(N)) time and each update in O(sqrt(N)) time.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - **Block Processing**: Divide the holes into blocks of size approximately sqrt(N). For each hole in a block, precompute:\n     - `next[i]`: The next hole outside the current block (or -1 if it exits the row).\n     - `steps[i]`: The number of steps to exit the current block.\n     - `last[i]`: The last hole visited within the current block before exiting.\n   - **Updates**: When updating a hole's power, recompute the entire block containing that hole from right to left to maintain correct `next`, `steps`, and `last` values.\n   - **Queries**: For a query starting at hole `a`, traverse through blocks using the precomputed values, accumulating the total steps and tracking the last hole visited before exiting.\n\n4. **Complexity Analysis**:\n   - **Preprocessing**: O(N) time to initialize blocks.\n   - **Updates**: O(sqrt(N)) per update, as only one block needs recomputation.\n   - **Queries**: O(sqrt(N)) per query, as each jump moves to a new block.\n   - **Overall**: O(M * sqrt(N)), which is feasible for N and M up to 100,000.\n\n### Solution Code", "inputs": ["10 10\n5 1 2 4 1 7 3 8 10 8\n0 5 6\n1 8\n1 1\n0 10 3\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2\n0 6 1\n1 9\n1 1\n", "10 10\n5 1 2 8 1 7 3 8 10 8\n0 5 6\n1 8\n1 1\n0 10 3\n1 5\n1 3\n1 2\n0 6 1\n1 9\n1 1\n", "8 5\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2\n1 1\n0 1 3\n1 1\n0 3 4\n1 2\n"], "expected_outputs": ["8 1", "6 2", "5 1", "5 2", "5 3", "9 1", "10 4", "8 1", "6 2", "5 1", "5 2", "5 3", "9 1", "10 4", "7 7", "7 5", "7 3"], "generated_outputs": ["8 1", "6 2", "5 1", "5 2", "5 3", "9 1", "10 4", "8 1", "6 2", "5 1", "5 2", "5 3", "9 1", "10 4", "7 7", "7 5", "7 3"], "confusion_matrix": {"true_positives": 17, "true_negatives": 0, "false_positives": 0, "false_negatives": 0, "accuracy": 1.0, "precision": 1.0, "recall": 1.0, "f1_score": 1.0, "specificity": 0.0, "total_samples": 17}}
